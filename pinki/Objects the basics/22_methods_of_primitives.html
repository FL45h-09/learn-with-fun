    /* Objects are “heavier” than primitives. They require additional resources to support the internal machinery.
    #1. A primitive as an object 
        The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: String, Number, Boolean, Symbol and BigInt. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.
        For instance, there exists a string method 'str.toUpperCase()' that returns a capitalized str.
        
        The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:
        Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.
        The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.
        In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.
    
    a. the primitive strings method is 'str.toUpperCase()'    */
    let name = "pinki yadav";
    console.log(name.toUpperCase()); //PINKI YADAV
    console.log(name.substring(4, 9)); //i yad

    /* ☝ The string name is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property("pinki yadav"), a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like toUpperCase().
    That method runs and returns a new string (shown by console).
    The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive str alone. */

/*  b. A number has methods of its own, for instance, 'toFixed(n)' rounds the number to the given precision */
    let num = 1.2356;
    console.log(num.toFixed(3)); //1.236
    console.log(num.toFixed()); //1

/*  c. boolean 
    let emp = new Number(1);
    if(emp == 1){
        console.log("emp1 is here"); //emp1 is here, value return true
    }

/* d. typeof 
    let num1 = 2;
    let n = typeof(num1); 
    console.log(n);
    let m = num1.toString();
    console.log(typeof(m)); */

/*  c. null/undefined have no methods. The special primitives null and undefined are exceptions. They have no corresponding “wrapper objects” and provide no methods. In a sense, they are “the most primitive”.*/
    let test = 123;
    console.log(null.test); //Cannot read properties of null (reading 'test')
