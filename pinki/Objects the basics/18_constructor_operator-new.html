    // #1 constructor functions are regular funtions.

    // b. and should be executed with only "new" operators
    // the main purpose of constructors – to implement reusable object creation code. We create multiple users using constructor function.

    // #3 Return from constructor
    // Usually, constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this, and it automatically becomes the result.
    // 'return' with an object returns that object, in all other cases 'this' is returned.

            this.name = "Pinki";
            return {name : "Godzilla"};

        // example with an empty 'return'

            this.name = "Pinki";
            return;
        }
        alert(new SmallUer().name); // Pinki


    // #4 Method in Constructor
    /* Using 'constructor functions' to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.
    Of course, we can add to 'this' not only 'properties', but 'methods' as well.
    For instance, new User(name) below creates an object with the given name and the method sayHi: */

    function Employee3(name){
        this.name = name;
        this.sayHi = function(){
            alert("My name is : " + this.name);
        }
        let jack = new Employee3("Jack");
        // alert(jack.sayHi());    
        jack.sayHi();
