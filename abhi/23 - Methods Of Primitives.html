        // Methods Of Primitives

        /* key distinctions between primitives and objects. */

        /* Primitive */
        /* 1. It can only store one value. */
        /* 2. There are 7 primitive types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined. */

        /* An Object */
        /* 1. Object is capable of storing multiple values as properties */
        /* 2. Can be created with {}, for instance: {name: "John", age: 30}. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects. */

        /* One of the best thing about object is that we can store a function as one of its properties. For Example: */
        let obj = {
            name: "Abhi",
            sayHi: function(){
                console.log("Hi");
            }
        }
        obj.sayHi(); // Hi



        // A primitive as an object

        /* There are many things one would want to do with a primitive, like a string or a number. It would be great to access them using methods. */
        /* Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible. */
        /* To access primitives, js allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, boolean and symbols. */
        /* In order for that to work, a special "object wrapper" that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed */
        /* The "Object wrappers" are difeerent for each primitive type. Thus, they provide different sets of methods */
        /* For example, there exists a string method "str.toUpperCase()" that returns a capitalized "str". */
        
        let str = "Hello";
        console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // HELLO

        /* Here's what actually happens in "str.toUpperCase()": */
        /* 1. The string "str" is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like "toUpperCase()". */
        /* 2. That method runs and returns a new string (shown by console.log). */
        /* 3. The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive "str" alone. */


        /* A number has methods of its own, for instance, "toFixed(number)" rounds the number to the given precision: */

        let n = 0.12345;
        console.log(n.toFixed(3)); // 0.123


        
        // Note: "null" and "undefined" have no methods.
