        // Garbage Collection
        /* Garbage collection in javascript is a process in the javascript engine, which monitors all objects and removes those (for objects, it free up memory) that have become unreachable */
        /* Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions… All that takes memory. */


        // Reachability
        /* The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability. */
        /* “Reachable” values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory. */
        /* For example: */
        let user = {

        }

        /* Now it becomes unrechable, because no references to it. */

        console.log(`bio: ${bio.name}`); // Error
        /* Here the object is still reachable via "fname" variable so it must stay in memory */
        /* If we overwrite admin too it can be remover */
