        // Optional chaining '?.'

        /* The optional chaining "?." is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. */
        
        // The “non-existing property” problem

        let user = {};
        console.log(user.address.street); // Error

        /* Thats the expected output, Javascript works like this. As 'user.address.street' is "undefined", An attempt to get 'user.address.street' fails with an error. */
        /* In many practical cases we’d prefer to get "undefined" instead of an error here (meaning “no street”). */

        /* Another method to check */
        console.log(user.address ? user.address.street : 'undefined'); // Undefined
        /* It works, there's no error but its quite inelegant because the "user.address" appears twice in the code. */
        /* For more deeplly nested property, more repititions are required. */
        
        /* Another method to check */
        console.log(user.address && user.address.street && user.address.street.name); // undefined
        /* Using "And" we getting same problem as above is we have to repeat property name */



        // Optional chaining

        /* The Optional chaining "?." stops the evaluation, if the value before "?." is "undefined" or "null" and returns "undefined". */

        /* In other words, "value?.prop": */
        /* 1. works as "value.prop", if "value" exists, */
        /* 2. Otherwise (when value is "undefined/null") it returns "undefined". */

        console.log(user?.address?.street); // undefined
        
        /* Here the code is shoreter and clean, there's no repetition of property value. */
        
        /* Note: The "?." syntax makes optional the value before it, but not any further. */
        
        /* For example: */
        console.log(user?.address.street.name); // error
        /* In above example: In "user?.address.street.name" the "?." allows "user" to safely be null/undefined */
        /* But thats only for "user". Further properties are accessed in a regular way. If we want some of them to be optional, then we need to replace more "." with "?.". */


        /* We have define a variable, other wise it will throw an error. */
        /* The variable must be declared. */
        console.log(bio?.name); // Error
