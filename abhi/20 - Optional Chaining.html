        // Optional chaining '?.'

        /* The optional chaining "?." is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist. */
        
        // The “non-existing property” problem

        let user = {};
        //console.log(user.address.street); // Error

        /* Thats the expected output, Javascript works like this. As 'user.address.street' is "undefined", An attempt to get 'user.address.street' fails with an error. */
        /* In many practical cases we’d prefer to get "undefined" instead of an error here (meaning “no street”). */

        /* Another method to check */
        console.log(user.address ? user.address.street : 'undefined'); // Undefined
        /* It works, there's no error but its quite inelegant because the "user.address" appears twice in the code. */
        /* For more deeplly nested property, more repititions are required. */
        
        /* Another method to check */
        console.log(user.address && user.address.street && user.address.street.name); // undefined
        /* Using "And" we getting same problem as above is we have to repeat property name */



        // Optional chaining

        /* The Optional chaining "?." stops the evaluation, if the value before "?." is "undefined" or "null" and returns "undefined". */

        /* In other words, "value?.prop": */
        /* 1. works as "value.prop", if "value" exists, */
        /* 2. Otherwise (when value is "undefined/null") it returns "undefined". */

        console.log(user?.address?.street); // undefined
        
        /* Here the code is shoreter and clean, there's no repetition of property value. */
        
        /* Note: The "?." syntax makes optional the value before it, but not any further. */
        
        /* For example: */
        //console.log(user?.address.street.name); // error
        /* In above example: In "user?.address.street.name" the "?." allows "user" to safely be null/undefined */
        /* But thats only for "user". Further properties are accessed in a regular way. If we want some of them to be optional, then we need to replace more "." with "?.". */


        /* We have define a variable, other wise it will throw an error. */
        /* The variable must be declared. */

        console.log(info.age); // Undefined

        /* Here the property before "?." doesn't exist it will show "Undefined" */
        /* It checks left part of "?." */



        // Short-circuiting
        /* As it was said before, the "?." immediately stops (“short-circuits”) the evaluation if the left part doesn’t exist. */
        /* So, if there are any further function calls or operations to the right of "?.", they won’t be made. */

        let marks = null;
        let x = 0;
        console.log(marks?.sayHi(x++)); // Undefined

        /* There is no user, so the execution doesn't reach sayHi */



        // Other variants: ?.(), ?.[]
        /* The optional chaining "?." is not an operator, but a special syntax construct, that also works with functions and square brackets. */
        /* For example: "?.()" is used to call a function that may not exist */

            admin() {

        userGuest.admin?.(); // Nothinmg happens in console

        /* Here, in both lines we first use the dot (userAdmin.admin) to get "admin" property, because we assume that the user object exists, so it’s safe read from it. */
        /* Then "?.()" checks the left part: if the "admin" function exists, then it runs (that’s so for userAdmin). Otherwise (for userGuest) the evaluation stops without errors. */
        /* The "?.[]" syntax also works, if we’d like to use brackets "[]" to access properties instead of dot. Similar to previous cases, it allows to safely read a property from an object that may not exist. */
